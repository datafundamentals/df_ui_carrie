A few notes about Carrie
====

Carrie is a demonstration project for automating some big data devops tasks such as setting up dev machines and writing automated ETL code to these same machines.

It is appropriately named after the horror movie of the same name. Automation should create the same kinds of feelings.

In its current state it is barely started, but it shall remain incomplete for it's entire life. It is not intended as anything other than exploratory software. 

The UI is built using Bootstrap and Sinatra. The generation programs are written in Ruby. All three technologies are bran new technologies to the author of Carrie, and the hacky nature of the code should reflect this fact. Carrie is a demostration project and never intended to be anything close to production code.

Choices Made By Disabled UI
====

In the spirit of increasing the horror factor, Carrie provides a context for many of it's design decisions by showing disabled choices.

In other words, Carrie may offer a limited set of options to you for generating your dev environments, but that doesn't mean that these choices were made in a vacuum. We show you many of the choices that we didn't yet make, by simply disabling the ones we didn't enable.

Presumably, with enough budget, any choices that are disabled could be enabled. This gives you a way of understanding your choices against the many that could be, or could have been, still made.
